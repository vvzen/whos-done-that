#+title: Readme

A very simple CLI to check who's done the most commits/edits on a git repo, without having to remember the magic incantation for the ~git shortlog~ command every time.

* Building

I wrote this in Rust using

#+begin_src bash :noeval
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.80.1 (3f5fd8dd4 2024-08-06)
#+end_src

I'm pretty sure the Rust Minimum Supported Version is way lower than that but I have no way of testing it.

If you have rust installed (see https://docs.aci.apple.com/artifactory/cargo.html or the public https://www.rust-lang.org) you can build the project with cargo, as usual: ~cargo build --release~.

Then you can put the resulting CLI (~./target/release/whos-done-that~) anywhere in your $PATH.

* Usage

Since this was written in an afternoon and a bit, there's no a lot of bells and whistles.

You just need to point the CLI at a valid git repo, by using the ~t~/~target-dir~ flag.

The actual result will be written to stdout so you can manipulate it via the usual UNIX tools, e.g.:
#+begin_src bash :noeval
$ whos-done-that -t ~/dev/personal/opensource/OpenColorIO | -n 5
